\section*{Acknowledgements} 

The work presented in this thesis has been carried out between 2014 and 2019 at the University of Jyväskylä, at the University of Helsinki and at CERN. I would like to open my thesis by acknowledging the help I have received from several people making my graduation possible.

First, I would like to thank my supervisors Dong Jo Kim and Jan Rak. Dong Jo for his guidance and patience and Jan for giving me the opportunity to work in this field.

Additionally from our research group I would like to highlight Sami Räsänen for his help in both practical and physics matters and providing feedback to my thesis. I would also like to thank the present and past members of the ALICE Jyväskylä group for providing a pleasant working environment.


I would like to thank Stefan Bathe and Marcin Chrząszcz for reviewing my thesis and providing useful comments and Jamie Nagle for agreeing to be my Opponent.

A special thanks goes to my family and friends for all the support I have received both before and during my academic career.

Finally I would like to acknowledge the financial support I have received from the University of Jyväskylä and the Helsinki Institute of Physics.
