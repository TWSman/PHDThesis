Keywords: jet, jet shape, jet fragmentation, jet reconstruction, p--Pb, ALICE,  transverse momentum, CERN, LHC

The main contributions of the author are listed below

\begin{itemize}
\item Jet fragmentation transverse momentum (\jt{}) analysis for  \sqrtSnnE{5.02} p--Pb data
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation of the observable (\jt{})
\item Implementation and improvement of the perpendicular cone background method
\item Developing the random background method
\item Performing unfolding of detector effects on the data
\item Systematic uncertainty analysis
\item Discussion of the results and comparing data to models and \jt{} extracted from two-particle correlations
\end{itemize}
\item Quality assurance (QA) of the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils that are built into the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) detector of the ALICE experiment
\end{itemize}
