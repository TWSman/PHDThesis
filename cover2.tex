%\section*{Abstract} 
\noindent
In this thesis we study the transverse structure of reconstructed jets via transverse fragmentation momentum, $\jt{}$, distributions in proton-lead (p--Pb) collisions at the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon of 5.02 TeV. The data is measured with the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC. 

In previous analysis that used two-particle correlations, it has been observed that the measured \jt{} distributions can be factorised into two components, a narrow Gaussian component, and a wide non-Gaussian component. It was argued that these components can be linked to the non-perturbative hadronisation and to the perturbative showering process, respectively. We have observed the same factorisation holds for $\jt{}$ distributions obtained using reconstructed jets. Furthermore although a direct quantitative comparison is not possible, our data is qualitatively compatible with $\jt{}$ distributions measured from two-particle correlations.

Studies of collective flow in high multiplicity p--Pb collisions have seen hints of behaviour that in Pb--Pb collisions has been taken as indication of the creation of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of QCD matter. However studies of jet observables have shown no modification in high multiplicity p--Pb collisions. As expected it has been observed in Pb--Pb collisions that jets traversing through QGP medium will lose energy from interactions with the medium. Thus it remains an open question whether QGP is created in a p--Pb collision. In this thesis we compare measured \jt{} distributions between minimum bias and high multiplicity p--Pb collisions.  Our results show no sign of modification within the current experimental capabilities.
