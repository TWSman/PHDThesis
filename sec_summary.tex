%The unfolding was also applied to AMPT data. Studies showed that even though average $v_n$ values in Toy Monte Carlo were the same for event plane method and unfolding, there is difference between the AMPT data. It was also seen that the shape of the $v_2$ distributions in peripheral collisions do not match the distribution that was first assumed.
